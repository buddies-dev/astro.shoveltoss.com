          <h2 class="text-lg">Determine The Order</h2>
          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base pl-2 border-l">
            A game of rock-paper-scissors is held. The winner selects if they would like to go first or second.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-lg">Inning</h2>
          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base pl-2 border-l">
            Each person receives a toss in an inning in the order the match begins until one of the players reach 15. The inning is still completed if the first person to toss reaches 15 (exactly). It is important to announce the score after every inning.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-lg">Going Over</h2>
          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base pl-2 border-l">
            If a player goes over 15 points the number of points they exceeded 15 by gets subtracted from 15 and becomes their point total. (Ex. Player hits 17, 2 over 15, so 15-2 = 13. Their score is now 13).
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-lg">Redemption</h2>
          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base pl-2 border-l">
            If at the end of an inning, one contestant hits 15 points (exactly) the other player gets a redemption shot. If they stick the shovel in the garden, they receive an additional throw until they reach 15 points (exactly) or fail to stick the shovel in the garden.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>

          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base pl-2 border-l">
